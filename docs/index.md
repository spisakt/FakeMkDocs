# Welcome!

## Jazz standards with a Barry Harris-inspired notation.

- uppercase letter or uppercase roman number: major six of the given note or degree
- lowercase letter or lowecase roman number: minor 6th opf the given note
- prime symbol: an arbitrary diminished chord of the given chord (this will serve as a basis of the usual dominat chords)
- double prime symbol: like the previous but one semi-tone higher (e.g. secondary dominant)
- triple prime symbol: like the previous but two semi-tone higher (a very nice alternative cadence, especially for the ii minor7, see e.g. "I can't give you anything")

|   BH-notation   | conventional  | 
|-----------------|---------------|
| I       | Imaj6   |
| C       | Cmaj6   |
| iv      | Fmin6   |
| f       | Dmin6   |
| I'     | IIdim or IVdim or bVdim or VIdim|
| C'     | Ddim or Fdim or Abdim or Bdim|
| C"      | Dbdim or Edim or Gdim or Bbdim|
| C"'      | Cdim or Ebdim or Gbdim or Aim|


- superscripts generally mean extensions (or melody notes)
- a somewhat special use of superscripts is to denote min7 chords (this is for convenience; min7 can be considered the 6th inversion of a maj6 chord in the BH-system). We will only use this for minor tunes (to avoid transposing the root)

|   BH-notation   | conventional  | 
|-----------------|---------------|
| i<sup>7</sup>  | Imin7     |
| c<sup>7</sup>   | Cmin7     |
| c<sup>7,9</sup> | Cmin79    |


- subscripts denote the (recommended) bass note (i.e. recommended inversion. No subscript usually means root in the bass (recommendation only).

|   BH-notation   | conventional  | 
|-----------------|---------------|
| I' <sup>5</sup> <sub>5</sub>     | V7     |
| C' <sup>5</sup> <sub>5</sub>     | G7     |

- further supeerscripts denote melody notes (also usually good extensions for comping). Melody often anticpatates the next chord, in such cases we write it to that chord.

|   BH-notation   | conventional  | 
|-----------------|---------------|
| C<sup>5,3,7</sup>               | Melody of Misty ('Look at me...')    |

- here's how a major II-V-I looks like:

|   BH-notation   | conventional  | 
|-----------------|---------------|
| IV<sub>6</sub>                            | Dmin7   |
| I'<sup>5</sup> <sub>5</sub>     | G7     |
| I<sup>7</sup> <sub>1</sub>                | Cmaj7 or C67   |

- and here's the mino II-V-I:

|   BH-notation   | conventional  | 
|-----------------|---------------|
| iv<sub>6</sub>                            | Dmin7b5   |
| i'<sup>5</sup> <sub>5</sub>     | G7     |
| i<sup>7</sup> <sub>1</sub>                | Cmin7     |

Don't be afraid when seeing the IV instead of the II. You will see that alternating between the I and the IV becomes a supper-common move anyway with this system

Yes, this is a minor ii-V-i

base note, kind, bass(+addons), melody notes relative to the base note

#### Improvise easily:
- look only at the first two character. Only 3 main characters: e.g I,+ -> major 6, I,- -> minor 6 I,= -> minor 7 (inversion of major 6)
- this usually changes much slower than in the fake/real books but still makes a lot of sense usually
- consider touching melody notes
#### Comping:
- same as for soloing
#### Bass: 
- look at the first three characters, the third is your root
#### Compoing without bass:
- look at the first three characters, the third is your root
#### Solo performance
- use all!


## Major II-V-I

### II chord

II,=: IImin7 (IV major sixth with 6th in the bass)

or 

I,d,21 (arbitrary diminished with the 2th *of the I* in the bass and with the root *of the I* added)

### V chord

I,d,5: (arbitrary diminished with the 5th *of the I* in the bass)

### I chord

I,-- (minor 7th)
*note: I,-- is actually the same as III,+ and I,+ is the same as VI,-- but to clearly display the tonality of the song (minor/major), we will use I,-- whenever possible*

## minor II-V-I

### II chord

IV,-,6 (IV minor sixth with 6th in the bass): IImin7b5

or 

I,d,21 (arbitrary diminished with the 2th *of the I* in the bass and with the root *of the I* added)

### V chord

I,d,5: (arbitrary diminished with the 5th *of the I* in the bass)

### I chord

I,-- (minor 7th)
*note: I,-- is actually the same as III,+ and I,+ is the same as VI,-- but to clearly display the tonality of the song (minor/major), we will use I,-- whenever possible*
