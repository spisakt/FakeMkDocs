# Welcome!

## Jazz standards with a Barry Harris-inspired notation.

base note, kind, bass(+addons), melody notes relative to the base note

#### Improvise easily:
- look only at the first two character. Only 3 main characters: e.g I,+ -> major 6, I,- -> minor 6 I,-- -> minor 7
- this usually changes much slower than in the fake/real books but still makes a lot of sense usually
- consider touching melody notes
#### Comping:
- same as for soloing
#### Bass: 
- look at the first three characters, the third is your root
#### Compoing without bass:
- look at the first three characters, the third is your root
#### Solo performance
- use all!


## Major II-V-I

### II chord

II,-- (IV minor sixth with 6th in the bass): IImin7b5

or 

I,d,21 (arbitrary diminished with the 2th *of the I* in the bass and with the root *of the I* added)

### V chord

I,d,5: (arbitrary diminished with the 5th *of the I* in the bass)

### I chord

I,-- (minor 7th)
*note: I,-- is actually the same as III,+ and I,+ is the same as VI,-- but to clearly display the tonality of the song (minor/major), we will use I,-- whenever possible*
